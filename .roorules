# Project Overview

This is a SPA that uses React and Vite, with Jotai for handling state and Tailwind for styling.

## Code Practices

- Keep components relatively simple, if theres a lot of code, use a hook to organize the code better or split in smaller components.
- Use Jotai Atoms for state, prefer using Atoms across components rather than passing props several levels down.
- Keep in mind responsive layouts when designing interfaces.
